* Improve UI by adding visual feedback on the weighting of Watson's answers
* Implement use of JSON instead of XML for retrieving of answers from Watson (JSON was used initially but I ran into problems and insufficient time to figure out a solution, so switched to XML; JSON should be simpler to parse than XML)
* Improve look and feel with colour/images
